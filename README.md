# Operating-Systems

This repo consists of random operating systems project I have done whilst reading "Operating Systems Concepts by Abraham Silberschatz, Peter Baer Galvin, and Greg Gagne" or random projects I made up because I was bored <br> 
Each project is categorized based off section, and each project should have its own README 

For every project simply run the make command, then some executable will be generated<br>
Note that some projects will require some sort of user input, so read the READMEs if you need to<br>
To remove the executables properly, simply run <br>
$ make clean 

If there are some OS project that are not listed here and you want to see then feel free to leave an Issue and I can get to it when I have the chance

These are for learning purposes, please don't plagerize it

The style should follow that of the linux kernel 6.6 styling guide found here: 
https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v6.6/process/coding-style.html
