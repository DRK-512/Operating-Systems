# Operating-Systems

This repo consists of random operating systems project I have done whilst reading Operating Systems Concepts by Abraham Silberschatz, Peter Baer Galvin, and Greg Gagne or during my operating systems course (CS-451) at Kettering University <br> 
Each project is categorized based off section, and each project should have its own README 

Makefiles and directions on how to run them coming soon 
For now, just run the run.bash files to generate an executable to run
