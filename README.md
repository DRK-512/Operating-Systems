# Operating-Systems

This repo consists of random operating systems project I have done whilst reading "Operating Systems Concepts by Abraham Silberschatz, Peter Baer Galvin, and Greg Gagne" or random projects I made up because I was bored <br> 
Each project is categorized based off section, and each project should have its own README 

For every project simply run <br>
$ make
Then some executable will be generated, and will run the executable
If it is not ran, then it needs user inputs to run 
To remove the executables properly, simply run <br>
$ make clean 

If there are some OS project that are not listed here and you want to see then feel free to leave an Issue and I can get to it when I have the chance

NOTE: 
These are for learning purposes, please don't plagerize it
