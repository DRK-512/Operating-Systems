# Operating-Systems

This repo consists of random operating systems project I have done whilst reading Operating Systems Concepts by Abraham Silberschatz, Peter Baer Galvin, and Greg Gagne or during my operating systems course (CS-451) at Kettering University <br> 
Each project is categorized based off section, and each project should have its own README 

For every project simply run <br>
$ make
Then some executable will be generated, and will not run
If it is not ran, then it needs user inputs to run 
To remove the executables, simply run <br>
$ make clean
