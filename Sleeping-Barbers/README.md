# Sleeping-Barbers

The senario here is that there is a barber shop which has one barber, one barber chair, and n chairs for waiting for customers if there are any to sit on the chair.
- If there is no customer, then the barber sleeps in his own chair.
- When a customer arrives, he has to wake up the barber.
- If there is more than one customer and the barber is cutting a customerâ€™s hair, then the remaining customers must wait until if there are empty chairs in the waiting room or they leave if no chairs are empty.
