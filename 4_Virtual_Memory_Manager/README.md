# Virtual Memory Manager with PageTable

# To compile the code use following command:
```bash 
$ gcc main.c -o output
```

# How it is run:
```bash
$ ./output address.txt process.txt
```

## Note:
- You must use the address.txt file first, 
- The reason for this is because if the process file goes first the code will treat the process file as the addresses, and the addresses as the process
- An example of how the output would look if you switched the process and address when inputing them into the function, that will be listed below
