# Least Recently Used (LRU)
This scheduler selects the task or process that has not been used for the longest time.
This approach is often used in memory management and caching rather than in process scheduling but can be adapted for process management scenarios.
It aims to prioritize tasks that are used less frequently to ensure that older tasks are executed before newer ones.
