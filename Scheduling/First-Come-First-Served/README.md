# First-Come, First-Served
- First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) Scheduling: processes are executed in the order in which they arrive in the system. It is a non-preemptive scheduling algorithm.
- The goal of this project is to grab a file "processes.txt", look at the processes listed, and implement a FCFS algorithm to schedule each of those threads
- The threads will be running a script to find the largrest prime number after some randomly generated uint 32
