# Operating-Systems

This repository consists of Operating System projects I have done for fun, or for my Operating Systems class for Kettering
Folders beginning with a number were assigned to me, wheras the others I did out of leisure
- 1_Own_PS_Program: A better version of the ps -aux | grep function
- 2_Shortest_Runtime_Scheduler: Simuilation of a shorest runtime scheudler with the use of a child as the process
- 3_Game_Parlor: A simulated game parlor, where the parlor has 8 dice, and each game costs a number of dice
- 4_Virtual_Memory_Manager: A program that allocates, deallocates, and compacts memory as the user requests
- Dining-Philosophers: The Dining Philosopher Problem states that K philosophers seated around a circular table with one chopstick between each pair of philosophers. There is one chopstick between each philosopher. A philosopher may eat if he can pick up the two chopsticks adjacent to him. One chopstick may be picked up by any one of its adjacent followers but not both. 
- Elevator-Threading: A simulated elavator system, where the people are the threads
- Priority-Scheduler: Simuilation of a scheudler which runs processes by priority
- Reader-Writer: A situation where we have a file shared between many people, and many can read at once, but only one can write at a time
