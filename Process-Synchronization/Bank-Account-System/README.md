# Multi-Threaded Bank Account System
## Description
Develop a simulation of a banking system where multiple threads represent different customers or transactions interacting with bank accounts. This project will focus on managing concurrent access to shared resources (bank accounts) and handling potential race conditions and deadlocks.
## Key Components:
- Bank Accounts: Represent individual accounts with balance and operations (e.g., deposit, withdraw).
- Transactions: Simulate multiple transactions occurring concurrently (e.g., deposits and withdrawals).
- Synchronization Mechanisms: Use mutexes, semaphores, or other synchronization primitives to manage access to shared resources and prevent race conditions.
- Deadlock Handling: Implement strategies to detect and prevent deadlocks, such as lock ordering or timeout mechanisms.
## Challenges:
- Race Conditions: Ensure that concurrent transactions do not corrupt the state of the bank accounts. For example, multiple threads trying to withdraw or deposit money simultaneously should be handled correctly.
- Deadlocks: Prevent situations where two or more threads are waiting for each other to release resources, causing the system to halt. Implement strategies like deadlock detection and recovery or prevention techniques.
- Consistency: Ensure the system maintains the integrity of account balances and operations, even under concurrent access.
## Additional Features:
Transaction Logs: Keep logs of all transactions to help with debugging and analysis.
Stress Testing: Test the system under high loads and concurrent transactions to identify potential issues.
This project will give you practical experience with race conditions, deadlocks, and various synchronization techniques, making it a valuable addition to your threading and concurrency projects.
