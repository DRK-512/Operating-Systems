# Reader-Writer Problem

The Reader-Writer problem is a situation where we have a file shared between many people, and many can read at once, but only one can write at a time 
For our example we have 5 Students and a teacher, and the teachers assistant

- When the teacher or the assistant is writting on the board, the students can't read it because they are so fat and cover the whole board
- Because of this, the students can only read the board if neither the teacher nor his assistant are writting
- The teacher & the assistant are aware of this, so when they are done writting they step aside and let the students right down the notes on the board
- If you want to add more than 1 teachers assistant, simply modify the numTeachers define
